#Synopsis#
This project required me to recreate a webpage from an image of a webpage or what they call a pixel perfect project.

##Objective##
The project required me to display a basic understanding of how HTML tags. It also required me to display a basic understanding of how to style content with CSS properties.

This project required me to use CSS layout strategies like float, inline, and block. I was also required to demonstrate that I could use CSS positioning context like absolute and relative positioning.

###Deliverables###
I included Normalize CSS code that would allow this webpage to work with many different types of browsers.

I used links for Google Fonts to allow me to change the font types of certain texts.
